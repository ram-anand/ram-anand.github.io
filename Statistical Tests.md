# The types of variables 

## Quantitative variables 

represent amounts of things (e.g. the number of trees in a forest). 
Types of quantitative variables include:

### Continuous (a.k.a ratio variables)
represents measures and can usually be divided into units smaller than one (e.g. 0.75 grams).
### Discrete (a.k.a integer variables)
represent counts and usually canâ€™t be divided into units smaller than one (e.g. 1 tree).

## Qualitative Variables or Categorical variables 
represents groupings of things (e.g. the different tree species in a forest). Types of categorical variables include:

### Ordinal: represent data with an order (e.g. rankings).
### Nominal: represent group names (e.g. brands or species names).
### Binary: represent data with a yes/no or 1/0 outcome (e.g. win or lose).

Choose the test that fits the types of predictor and outcome variables you have collected (if you are doing an experiment, these are the independent and dependent variables). Consult the tables below to see which test best matches your variables.
